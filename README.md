Express.js project using EJS as the templating engine. The project demonstrates dynamic creation of HTML elements based on user input.

For some configuration reason, the pages were not being referenced correctly when the JavaScript and CSS were placed in separate files. Therefore, I decided to place the JavaScript and CSS directly in the same file for simplicity and to ensure proper functionality.

Requirements
Node.js (version 12 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
